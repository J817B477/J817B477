## Current Endeavors
### Jackson Laboratories
I am beginning a Academic Year Fellowship at Jackson Laboratory in Farmington, CT. I will be contributing to an existing project in blood transcriptomics by helping with the development of a transcriptome module to contribute to an existing repertoire 
 which provides diagnostic transcription profiles across multiple biological conditions. (My role is currently being developed and I will update this overtime).

### Academic Courses
I am currently enrolled in collegiate courses pertaining to my data science major including Database Design (MySQL), Intro to AI (Python), Statistics (R/Python). Prior courses include programming language courses (Java, C++, JavaScript), Data Structures (Java) Intro Statistics (in R), Intro to DataScience (both a course in R and Python), and Predictive Modeling (in R), as well as courses general biology and genetics. 

## Past Endeavors
### Past Projects
 Most of my projects have been academic in nature but include interactive webpages and terminal applications, predictive models using transciption/translation data, and development of datasets for a municipal National Resource Inventory Project. (Projects need to be established as repositories here).
